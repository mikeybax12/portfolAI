# Database Migration Guide

## Upgrading to Action Items & Personal Notes Feature

This guide will help you upgrade your existing PortfolAI database to support the new features:
- âœ… Action items with checkboxes on meeting cards
- ðŸ’¬ "Remember for Next Time" personal notes
- ðŸ“Š Enhanced sentiment scoring (0-10 scale with color gradients)

---

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Database (IMPORTANT!)

Before making any changes, **backup your existing database**:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
pg_dump -U postgres -d portfolai > portfolai_backup.sql
```

If something goes wrong, you can restore with:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d portfolai < portfolai_backup.sql
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script

Navigate to your project directory and run the migration:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Bobby Baxter\ai-advisor-chat"
psql -U postgres -d portfolai -f database-migration.sql
```

Enter your PostgreSQL password when prompted.

You should see:
```
ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE
UPDATE X
ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE
       status
------------------------
 Migration completed successfully!
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration

Connect to your database and verify the changes:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d portfolai

# Check the meetings table structure
\d meetings

# You should see these new columns:
# - sentiment (integer, 0-10)
# - action_items (jsonb)
# - personal_notes (jsonb)

# Exit
\q
```

## What Changed?

### Database Schema

**Before:**
```sql
sentiment VARCHAR(20)  -- "positive", "negative", "neutral"
```

**After:**
```sql
sentiment INTEGER CHECK (sentiment >= 0 AND sentiment <= 10)
action_items JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb
personal_notes JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb
```

### Data Migration

Your existing meetings will be automatically converted:
- `"positive"` â†’ `8/10`
- `"neutral"` â†’ `5/10`
- `"negative"` â†’ `2/10`

New meetings will get AI-generated:
- Sentiment scores from 0-10
- Action items extracted from notes
- Personal notes for relationship building

---

## Testing the Migration

1. **Start your server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Start your frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test the new features:**
   - Create a new meeting with notes like:
     ```
     Client wants to rollover $500k from old 401k.
     Needs withdrawal paperwork for daughter's wedding next month.
     Seemed very happy with portfolio performance.
     ```

   - You should see:
     - âœ… Action items: "Process $500k rollover", "Send withdrawal paperwork"
     - ðŸ’¬ Remember: "Ask how daughter's wedding went"
     - Sentiment: "Very Positive (8/10)" with green color

4. **Test existing meetings:**
   - Your old meetings should display with converted sentiment scores
   - Click on a client to see their meeting history
   - Sentiment badges should show colors (red for low, grey for neutral, green for high)

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback to your backup:

```bash
# Drop the current database
psql -U postgres -c "DROP DATABASE portfolai;"

# Recreate it
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE portfolai;"

# Restore from backup
psql -U postgres -d portfolai < portfolai_backup.sql
```

## Deploying to Railway (Production)

If you're using Railway for production:

1. **Push your code changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add action items and personal notes features"
   git push
   ```

2. **Run migration on Railway database:**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click on your PostgreSQL database
   - Go to "Query" tab
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database-migration.sql`
   - Click "Run Query"

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Railway will automatically redeploy your backend
   - Visit your production URL to test the new features

## Troubleshooting

### "relation does not exist" error
- Make sure you're connected to the correct database (`portfolai`)
- Check that the migration script ran successfully

### Action items not showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the `action_items` column exists: `\d meetings` in psql
- Try creating a new meeting (old meetings won't have action items)

### Sentiment colors not working
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- Clear browser cache
- Check that sentiment values are integers (not text)

### Migration failed
- Restore from backup (see Rollback section)
- Check PostgreSQL error messages
- Ensure you're running the latest code
